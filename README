Net::ZKMon - Perl extension for Apache ZooKeeper Monitoring
===========================================================
About Apache ZooKeeper:

From http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/: 
"ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications."

It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - 
  in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. 
  You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, 
  leader election, and presence protocols.

Zookeeper exposes 4 letter keywords meant for simple monitoring of the ensemble service.
